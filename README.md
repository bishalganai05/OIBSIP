# Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship Project

This repository contains projects completed during the Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship from July 01, 2023, to July 31, 2023. The internship covered various data science tasks focusing on classification, analysis, prediction, and machine learning techniques.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Iris Flower Classification
Developed a machine learning model to classify iris flower species based on petal and sepal dimensions.

### Task 2: Unemployment Analysis with Python
Conducted in-depth analysis of unemployment data using Python, exploring trends, patterns, and factors affecting unemployment rates.

### Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Implemented a machine learning model to predict car prices based on various features like mileage, make, model, etc.

### Task 4: Email Spam Detection with Machine Learning
Created a machine learning-based system capable of identifying spam emails from legitimate ones using text classification techniques.

### Task 5: Sales Prediction using Python
Predicted sales figures using historical sales data. The dataset and Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files for this task are provided in the repository.
